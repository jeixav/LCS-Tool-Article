Highlights

FIXME Reviewer #3: Highlights are so simple that they don't grasp the core contribution of the article.

- New computational platform to compute Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) from their geodesic theory
- Step by step explanation of LCS algorithms
- Three demo cases featuring analytic flow models and experimental flow data
