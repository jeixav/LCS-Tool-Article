  year =	 2007,

  abstract =	 {This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian
                  particle dynamics is used for the segmentation of
                  high density crowd flows and detection of flow
                  instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field
                  generated by a moving crowd is treated as an
                  aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is
                  overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a
                  numerical integration scheme. The evolution of
                  particles through the flow is tracked using a flow
                  map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used
                  to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for
                  quantifying the amount by which the neighboring
                  particles have diverged over the length of the
                  integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is
                  used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent
                  (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent
                  structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The
                  LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively
                  different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries
                  of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework.
                  Any change in the number of flow segments over time
                  is regarded as an instability, which is detected by
                  establishing correspondences between flow segments
                  over time. The experiments are conducted on a
                  challenging set of videos taken from Google Video
                  and a National Geographic documentary.},

                  degree of freedom systems excited by both weakly
                  periodic and random additive perturbations is
                  developed. The near-resonant motion of such systems
                  is not well understood. This problem is studied with
                  the aim of discovering a common geometric structure
                  in the phase space, and determining the effects of
                  noisy perturbations on the passage of trajectories
                  through the resonance zone. We consider the noisy,
                  periodically driven Duffing equation as a
                  prototypical single degree of freedom system and
                  achieve a model-reduction through stochastic
                  averaging. The solution of the reduced model can be
                  approximated by a Markov process. Depending on the
                  strength of the noise, the reduced Markov process
                  takes its values on a line or on a graph with
                  certain gluing conditions at the vertices of the
                  graph. The reduced model provides a framework for
                  computing standard statistical measures of dynamics
                  and stability such as probability density functions.
                  This work also explains a counter-intuitive
                  phenomenon in stochastic resonance, in which a weak
                  periodic forcing in a nonlinear system can be
                  enhanced by the addition of external noise.}

  abstract =	 {The properties of waves generated by a vertically
                  oscillating sphere in a uniformly stratified fluid
                  are examined both theoretically and experimentally.
                  Existing predictions for the wave amplitude and
                  phase structure are modified to account for the
                  effects of viscous attenuation. As with waves
                  generated by an oscillating cylinder, the main
                  effect of attenuation is to broaden the two peaks of
                  the amplitude envelope on either flank of the wave
                  beam so that far from the sphere the wave beam
                  exhibits a single peak with a maximum along the
                  centreline. The transition distance from bimodal to
                  unimodal wave beam structure is shown to occur
                  closer to the source than the corresponding distance
                  calculated for the oscillating circular cylinder.
                  For laboratory experiments, a recently developed
                  'synthetic schlieren' method is adapted so that
                  quantitative measurements may be made of an
                  axisymmetric wave field. This non-intrusive
                  technique allows us to evaluate the amplitude of the
                  waves everywhere in space and time. Experiments are
                  performed to examine the amplitude of waves
                  generated by small and large spheres oscillating
                  with a range of amplitudes and frequencies. The wave
                  amplitude is found to scale linearly with the
                  oscillation amplitude $A$ for $A/a$ as large as
                  0.27, where $a$ is the radius of the sphere.
                  Generally good agreement between theory and
                  experiment is found for the small sphere
                  experiments. However, the theory overpredicts both
                  the amplitude and the bimodal-to-unimodal transition
                  distance for waves generated by the large sphere.}

  abstract =	 {Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the
                  most commonly diagnosed vertigo syndrome. It is
                  caused by movement of detached otoconia within the
                  inner ear (canalithiasis) or otoconia adherent to
                  the cupula (cupulolithiasis). A mathematical model
                  incorporating fluid dynamics of BPPV, which results
                  in the following insights, has been developed
                  recently: (1) The characteristic latency of BPPV is
                  explained by movement of detached otoconia through
                  the ampulla, as pressure caused by moving otoconia
                  is negligible until otoconia enter the narrow duct
                  of the semicircular canal. Typical otoconia move at
                  a rate of 0.2 mm/s, or about 1\% of the
                  circumference of the canal each second. (2)
                  Particle-wall interactions can account for the
                  considerable variability in duration and latency of
                  BPPV. (3) Dispersion of a clump of otoconia creates
                  more rather than less nystagmus. Thus, dispersion is
                  not a viable explanation of fatigability. (4)
                  Cupulolithiasis is predicted to cause a far weaker
                  nystagmus than canalithiasis. (5) Inertial effects
                  of treatment maneuvers cause negligible movement of
                  otoconia. },

                  individual tracer samples unreliable. Behind complex
                  and sensitive tracer patterns, however, there exists
                  a robust skeleton of material surfaces, Lagrangian
                  Coherent Structures (or LCSs), shaping those
                  patterns. Free from the uncertainties of single
                  trajectories, LCSs frame, quantify, and even
                  forecast key aspects of material transport. A number
                  of diagnostic quantities have been proposed to
                  visualize LCSs. More recent mathematical approaches
                  identify LCSs precisely through their impact of
                  these surfaces on fluid deformation. This review
                  focuses on the latter developments, illustrating
                  them on applications to geophysical fluid dynamics.}

                  tracer observations for flow state estimation is
                  presented. It is developed in the context of point
                  vortex systems. With tracer advection equations
                  augmenting the point vortex model, the correlations
                  between the vortex and tracer positions allow one to
                  use the observed tracer positions to update the
                  non-observed vortex positions. The method works
                  efficiently when the observations are accurate and
                  frequent enough. Low-quality data and large
                  intervals between observations can lead to
                  divergence of the scheme. Nonlinear effects,
                  responsible for the failure of the extended Kalman
                  filter, are triggered by the exponential rate of
                  separation of tracer trajectories in the
                  neighbourhoods of the saddle points of the velocity
                  field.},

  abstract =	 {Planetary flows-atmospheric and oceanic-are
                  approximately two-dimensional and dominated by
                  coherent concentrations of vorticity. Data
                  assimilation attempts to determine optimally the
                  current state of a fluid system from a limited
                  number of current and past observations. In this
                  two-part paper, an advanced method of data
                  assimilation, the extended Kalman filter, is applied
                  to the Lagrangian representation of a
                  two-dimensional flow in terms of vortex systems.
                  Smaller scales of motion are approximated here by
                  stochastic forcing of the vortices.In Part I, the
                  systems studied have either two point vortices,
                  leading to regular motion or four point vortices and
                  chaotic motion, in the absence of stochastic
                  forcing. Numerical experiments are performed in the
                  presence or absence of stochastic forcing.
                  Point-vortex systems with both regular and chaotic
                  motion can be tracked by a combination of Lagrangian
                  observations of vortex positions and of Eulerian
                  observations of fluid velocity at a few fixed
                  points. Dynamically, the usual extended Kalman
                  filter tends to yield insufficient gain if
                  stochastic forcing is absent, whether the underlying
                  system is regular or chaotic. Statistically, the
                  type and accuracy of observations are the key
                  factors in achieving a sufficiently accurate flow
                  description. A simple analysis of the update
                  mechanism supports the numerical results and also
                  provides geometrical insight into them. In Part II,
                  tracking of Rankine vortices with a finite core area
                  is investigated and the results are used for
                  observing-system design.},

                  developing rigorous methods to replace, in some
                  limiting regime, the original complicated system by
                  a 'simpler, constructive, and rational'
                  approximation - a low-dimensional model of the
                  dynamical system. To this end, we study the
                  equations as a random perturbation of a
                  two-dimensional Hamiltonian system. We achieve the
                  model-reduction through 'stochastic averaging' and
                  the reduced Markov process takes its values on a
                  graph with certain glueing conditions at the vertex
                  of the graph. Examination of the reduced Markov
                  process on the graph yields many important results,
                  namely, mean exit times, probability density
                  functions, and stochastic bifurcations.},

                  bundles by using the concept of the maximal Lyapunov
                  exponent. The motion of one tube in the bundle is
                  modeled as a two-degree-of-freedom (four

                  asymptotically stable mode driven by a small

                  the local bookstore, and you will surely catch a
                  glimpse of a portrait of a strange attractor, the
                  powerful visual icon of phase space. Though it was
                  used originally to describe specific types of
                  dynamical systems, today "phase space" has become
                  synonymous with the idea of a large parameter set:
                  Whether they are stock prices in economics, the dust
                  motes in Saturn's rings, or high-energy particles in
                  an accelerator, the degrees of freedom are loosely
                  called the phase space of the respective systems.
                  The concept and its name are embedded in our
                  scientific fluency and cultural literacy. In his
                  popular book Chaos on the history and science of
                  chaos theory, James Gleick calls phase space "one of
                  the most powerful inventions of modern science." But
                  who invented it? Who named it? And why?}

                  oceanic and atmospheric contamination hinders the
                  effective protection of the ecosystem, society, and
                  the economy from the fallouts of environmental
                  disasters. The consequences can be dire, as
                  evidenced by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the
                  Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to
                  predict major short-term changes in environmental
                  contamination patterns, such as oil spills in the
                  ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our approach
                  is based on new mathematical results on the
                  objective (frame-independent) identification of key
                  material surfaces that drive tracer mixing in
                  unsteady, finite-time flow data. Some of these
                  material surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent
                  structures (LCSs), turn out to admit highly
                  attracting cores that lead to inevitable material
                  instabilities even under future uncertainties or
                  unexpected perturbations to the observed flow. These
                  LCS cores have the potential to forecast imminent
                  shape changes in the contamination pattern, even
                  before the instability builds up and brings large
                  masses of water or air into motion. Exploiting this
                  potential, the LCS-core analysis developed here
                  provides a model-independent forecasting scheme that
                  relies only on already observed or validated flow
                  velocities at the time the prediction is made. We
                  use this methodology to obtain high-precision
                  forecasts of two major instabilities that occurred
                  in the shape of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
                  This is achieved using simulated surface currents
                  preceding the prediction times and assuming that the
                  oil behaves as a passive tracer.}

                  excitation is presented. The starting point is a
                  Hamiltonian model of surface wave motion. This model
                  is augmented with linear damping and stochastic
                  forcing terms. An asymptotic scaling parameter is
                  then introduced to show that the problem has three
                  time scales. Integrability of the system is
                  established for the case of two wave modes near 1:1
                  resonance. Stochastic averaging is used to reduce
                  the dimensions of the system from four to two and
                  the evolution of surface waves is now described,
                  over long time scales and small amplitude stochastic
                  forcing, by the evolution of the integrals of
                  motion, as a random process. The domain of the
                  generator of this random process is characterized
                  and it includes a 'gluing' boundary condition. The
                  adjoint of the generator yields the Fokker-Planck
                  partial-differential equation (FPE). This equation
                  governs the time evolution of the joint probability
                  density of the two integrals of motion. The
                  coefficients of the FPE are calculated numerically
                  and the steady-state solution is found using the
                  finite-element method. Results of the analysis show
                  a distinct peak in the probability density along one
                  edge of the reduced domain.}

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we introduce a new, local formulation
                  of the ensemble Kalman filter approach for
                  atmospheric data assimilation. Our scheme is based
                  on the hypothesis that, when the Earth's surface is
                  divided up into local regions of moderate size,
                  vectors of the forecast uncertainties in such
                  regions tend to lie in a subspace of much lower
                  dimension than that of the full atmospheric state
                  vector of such a region. Ensemble Kalman filters, in
                  general, take the analysis resulting from the data
                  assimilation to lie in the same subspace as the
                  expected forecast error. Under our hypothesis the
                  dimension of the subspace corresponding to local
                  regions is low. This is used in our scheme to allow
                  operations only on relatively low-dimensional
                  matrices. The data assimilation analysis is
                  performed locally in a manner allowing massively
                  parallel computation to be exploited. The local
                  analyses are then used to construct global states
                  for advancement to the next forecast time. One
                  advantage, which may take on more importance as
                  ever-increasing amounts of remotely-sensed satellite
                  data become available, is the favorable scaling of
                  the computational cost of our method with increasing
                  data size, as compared to other methods that
                  assimilate data sequentially. The method, its
                  potential advantages, properties, and implement
                  ation requirements are illustrated by numerical
                  experiments on the Lorenz-96 model. It is found that
                  accurate analysis can be achieved at a cost which is
                  very modest compared to that of a full global
                  ensemble Kalman filter. }

  abstract =	 {A methodology is described to optimize the economic
                  performance of district heating systems. This
                  methodology is very realistic, and is demonstrated
                  using heating systems for small commercial and
                  residential buildings, including domestic hot water
                  (DHW), situated in a district heating network
                  supplied from a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant.
                  The system is simulated for an entire year, with
                  measured hourly weather data (temperature and solar
                  radiation), using a fully dynamics simulation model
                  and analyzed by statistical methods. The development
                  of the simulation methodology is emphasized in this
                  paper. The models presented are not necessarily
                  final and other models or weather profiles can
                  easily be substituted. The simulations result in a
                  relationship between the incremental heat transfer
                  surface and the income from the thermal energy used
                  by the buildings, minus pumping costs, heat losses
                  and the amortized cost of the increase in heat
                  transfer are. This relationship indicated an optimum
                  in terms of building heat transfer area. It is
                  concluded that the economic performance of a
                  district heating system may be enhanced by an
                  analysis that combines the modeling of the heat
                  source, distribution network and heating systems of
                  the buildings connected to the system. Effects of
                  changes to one component can be analyzed with
                  respect to the entire system. Consequences of
                  changes in building operational strategy to the
                  system's economics can be accounted for.}

                  propagating in a density stratified fluid. In the
                  special case of two-dimensional internal waves (for
                  example, those created by an oscillating cylinder),
                  synthetic schlieren allows one to measure
                  non-intrusively the wave amplitudes everywhere in
                  space and time. The technique works by measuring the
                  apparent displacement of points in a digitised image
                  (such as a grid of horizontal lines), which is
                  observed by a CCD camera through the experimental
                  test section. Synthetic schlieren is sufficiently
                  sensitive that it can measure sub-pixel-scale
                  disturbances. In this work, we report on the first
                  step toward measuring fully three-dimensional
                  disturbances. We perform laboratory experiments in
                  which internal waves are generated in a uniformly
                  salt-stratified fluid by a vertically oscillating
                  sphere. Theory predicts that the resulting
                  wave-field is in the form of two cones emanating
                  above and below the sphere. Using inverse
                  tomographic techniques, we exploit the axisymmetry
                  of the wave-field to relate the apparent
                  displacement of pixels in an image to the wave
                  amplitudes.}

                  recently proposed local ensemble Kalman filter
                  (LEKF) data assimilation scheme is investigated on a
                  state-of-the-art operational numerical weather
                  prediction model using simulated observations. The
                  model selected for this purpose is the T62
                  horizontal- and 28-level vertical-resolution version
                  of the Global Forecast System (GFS) of the National
                  Center for Environmental Prediction. The performance
                  of the data assimilation system is assessed for
                  different configurations of the LEKF scheme. It is
                  shown that a modest size (40-member) ensemble is
                  sufficient to track the evolution of the atmospheric
                  state with high accuracy. For this ensemble size,
                  the computational time per analysis is less than 9
                  min on a cluster of PCs. The analyses are extremely
                  accurate in the mid-latitude storm track regions.
                  The largest analysis errors, which are typically
                  much smaller than the observational errors, occur
                  where parametrized physical processes play important
                  roles. Because these are also the regions where
                  model errors are expected to be the largest,
                  limitations of a real-data implementation of the
                  ensemble-based Kalman filter may be easily mistaken
                  for model errors. In light of these results, the
                  importance of testing the ensemble-based Kalman
                  filter data assimilation systems on simulated
                  observations is stressed. }

                  dimensional co-dimension two dynamical systems under
                  small intensity stochastic excitations is
                  investigated. The method of stochastic averaging is
                  used to derive a set of approximate It\={o} equations
                  which are then examined to obtain the almost-sure
                  stability conditions. The sample properties of the
                  process are based on the boundary behavior of the
                  associated scalar diffusion process of the amplitude
                  It\={o} equations. This method is then applied to a
                  linear, gyroscopic problem of a rotating shaft with
                  a random loading demonstrating the conservative
                  nature of mean square stability. In addition to
                  stochastic excitations, many systems also undergo
                  harmonic loading. The almost-sure stability of two
                  degree-of-freedom systems subjected to both random
                  and harmonic excitation is then investigated. In
                  this analysis, stochastic averaging followed by a
                  perturbation theoretic approximation is used to
                  facilitate the solution of the multi-dimensional
                  diffusive Markov process. The emerging field of
                  nonlinear control theory has attempted to alleviate
                  the problem associated with applying linear control
                  theory to nonlinear problems. A segment of nonlinear
                  control theory, called exact feedback linearization,
                  has proven useful in a class of problems satisfying
                  certain controllability and integrability
                  constraints. Approximate feedback linearization has
                  enlarged this class by weakening the integrability
                  conditions, but application of both these techniques
                  remains limited to problems in which a series of
                  linear partial differential equations can easily be
                  solved. By use of the idea of normal forms, from
                  dynamical systems theory, a method of obtaining the
                  necessary coordinate transformation and nonlinear
                  feedback rules is given. This method, algebraic in
                  nature, is valid for any dimensional system and any
                  order nonlinearity provided it meets the approximate
                  feedback linearization conditions.}

                  technique are used to analytically predict results
                  for the critical parameter at which the dynamical
                  system possesses a Smale horseshoe type of chaos for
                  1:2 and 1:1 internal resonance, respectively. 2. The
                  dynamic stability of general linear non-conservative
                  systems under stochastic parametric excitation is
                  examined. Conditions for mean square stability of
                  the dynamic response are obtained. Results are shown
                  to depend only on those values of the excitation
                  spectral density near twice the natural frequencies,
                  the difference and combination frequencies of the
                  system. The results are applied to the problem of a
                  cantilever column subjected to stochastic follower
                  force. 3. For nonlinear systems with strong cubic
                  nonlinearities, a new scheme of stochastic averaging
                  using elliptic functions is presented that
                  approximates nonlinear dynamical systems with strong
                  cubic nonlinearities in the presence of noise by a
                  set of It\={o} differential equations. This is an
                  extension of some recent results presented in
                  deterministic dynamical systems. The resulting
                  equations are Markov approximations of amplitude and
                  phase involving integrals of elliptic functions.
                  This method retains those nonlinear terms in the
                  response equations as opposed to the regular
                  averaging technique.}

                  swarming colonies of Paenibacillus dendritiformis
                  growing on semi-solid agar substrates. The bacteria
                  swim within a thin fluid layer, and they form
                  long-lived jets and vortices. These coherent
                  structures lead to anisotropy in velocity spatial
                  correlations and to a two-step relaxation in
                  velocity temporal correlations. The mean squared
                  displacement of passive tracers exhibits a
                  short-time regime with nearly ballistic transport
                  and a diffusive long-time regime. We find that
                  various definitions of the correlation length all
                  lead to length scales that are, surprisingly,
                  essentially independent of the mean bacterial speed,
                  while the correlation time is linearly proportional
                  to the ratio of the correlation length to the mean
                  speed.}
