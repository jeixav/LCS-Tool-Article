  abstract =      {Typical fluid particle trajectories are sensitive to
                   changes in their initial conditions. This makes the
                   assessment of flow models and observations from
                   individual tracer samples unreliable. Behind complex
                   and sensitive tracer patterns, however, there exists
                   a robust skeleton of material surfaces, Lagrangian
                   Coherent Structures (or LCSs), shaping those
                   patterns. Free from the uncertainties of single
                   trajectories, LCSs frame, quantify, and even forecast
                   key aspects of material transport. A number of
                   diagnostic quantities have been proposed to visualize
                   LCSs. More recent mathematical approaches identify
                   LCSs precisely through their impact of these surfaces
                   on fluid deformation. This review focuses on the
                   latter developments, illustrating them on
                   applications to geophysical fluid dynamics.},

                   Flow Segmentation and Stability Analysis},
  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian
                   particle dynamics is used for the segmentation of
                   high density crowd flows and detection of flow
                   instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field
                   generated by a moving crowd is treated as an
                   aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is
                   overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a
                   numerical integration scheme. The evolution of
                   particles through the flow is tracked using a flow
                   map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to
                   setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for
                   quantifying the amount by which the neighboring
                   particles have diverged over the length of the
                   integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is
                   used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent
                   (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent
                   structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The
                   LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively
                   different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries
                   of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework.
                   Any change in the number of flow segments over time
                   is regarded as an instability, which is detected by
                   establishing correspondences between flow segments
                   over time. The experiments are conducted on a
                   challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and
                   a National Geographic documentary.},

  abstract =      {The lack of reliable forecasts for the spread of
                   oceanic and atmospheric contamination hinders the
                   effective protection of the ecosystem, society, and
                   the economy from the fallouts of environmental
                   disasters. The consequences can be dire, as evidenced
                   by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of
                   Mexico in 2010. We present a methodology to predict
                   major short-term changes in environmental
                   contamination patterns, such as oil spills in the
                   ocean and ash clouds in the atmosphere. Our approach
                   is based on new mathematical results on the objective
                   (frame-independent) identification of key material
                   surfaces that drive tracer mixing in unsteady,
                   finite-time flow data. Some of these material
                   surfaces, known as Lagrangian coherent structures
                   (LCSs), turn out to admit highly attracting cores
                   that lead to inevitable material instabilities even
                   under future uncertainties or unexpected
                   perturbations to the observed flow. These LCS cores
                   have the potential to forecast imminent shape changes
                   in the contamination pattern, even before the
                   instability builds up and brings large masses of
                   water or air into motion. Exploiting this potential,
                   the LCS-core analysis developed here provides a
                   model-independent forecasting scheme that relies only
                   on already observed or validated flow velocities at
                   the time the prediction is made. We use this
                   methodology to obtain high-precision forecasts of two
                   major instabilities that occurred in the shape of the
                   Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This is achieved using
                   simulated surface currents preceding the prediction
                   times and assuming that the oil behaves as a passive
                   tracer.},
